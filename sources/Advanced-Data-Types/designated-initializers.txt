designated initializers allow you to specify which elements of an array, structure, or union are to be initialized by
the values following an array index or a field by name (struct and union)

the C90 standard required the elements on an initializer to appear in a fixed order

the C99 standard allows for initializing to a random order

i.e. 
int numbers[100] = {1, 2, 3, [3 ... 9] = 10, [10] = 80, 15, [70] = 50}

struct point { int x, int y, int z };

struct point p = { y: 2, x: 3}
