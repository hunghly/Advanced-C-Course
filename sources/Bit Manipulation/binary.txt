a binary number has only 1 & 0

Bits for the basic C data types
BIT     _Bool       1       0 or 1
Byte    char        8       -128 to 127
Word    short int   16      -32,768 to 32,767
Long    long int    32      -2,147,483,648 to -2,147,483,647

computers representation of negative numbers is handled slightly differently
computers represent such number using a "twos complement" notation
the left most bit represents the sign bit
-1 is negative, 0 is positive


to convert -5 to binary, the number 1 is added which gives -4
4 expressed in binary is 0000 00100, it's complement is 1111 1011 (-5)

to convert a negative number from binary back to decimal
-first complement all the Bits
-convert the result to decimal
-change the sign of the result
-then subtract 1

we need to understand these concepts in order to use bit operators and the concept of bit fields in C programming
-a hardware device is often controlled by sending it a byte or two in which each bit has a particular meaning
-operating system information about files is often stored by using particular bits to indicate particular items
