bit manipulation is the act of algorithmically manipulating bits or other pieces of data shorter than a word

computer programming tasks that require bit manipulation include:
-low level device control
-error detection
-correction algorithms
-data compression
-encryption algorithms
-optimization

-a bitwise operation operates on one or more binary numbers are the level of their individual bits
    -used to manipulate values for comparisons and calculations
    -substantially faster than division, several times faster than multiplication, and sometimes faster than addition

Bitwise Logical Operators
-C offers bitwise logical operators and shift operators
Operators   Description
&           Binary AND operator that copies a bit to the result if it exists in both operands
|           Binary OR operator that copies a bit if it exists in either operands
^           Binary XOR operator that copries the bit if it is set in one operand but NOT both
~           Binary Ones complement operator for unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits

-they operate on each bit independently of the bit to the left or right
-they are not the same as logical operators i.e. && and || and !
-all of the logical operators listed in the table except for the ones complement are binary operators

Use Case
-bit operations can be performed on any type of integer value in C
-int, short, long, long long, signed or unsigned and on chars, but not on floating pt values

-a bit mask is data that used for bitwise operations
    -using a mask, multiple bits in a Byte can be set to either on, off, or inverted from on to off to a single bitwise operation

-one major use of the bitwise AND & and bitwise OR | is in operations to test and set individual bits in an integer variable

-you can use a single integer variable to store several characteristics of a person
    -store whether the person is male or female with one bit
    -use three other bits to specify whether the person can speak french, german, or italian
    -use another bit to record whether the person's salary is 50k or more


-one of the features that set C apart from most high-level languages is it's ability to access individual bits in an integer (often used to interface with hardware devices and with operating systems)
