extern storage class tells us that a variable is defined elsewhere
-it is a global variable initialized with legal value where it is declared in order to be used elsewhere

-main purpose of using extern variable is that they can be accessed between two different files which are part of a larger program
-functions contained in separate files can communicate through external variables

inside the module that wants to access the external variable you would use the 'extern' keyword before the declaration

when a function is defined, it can be declared to be extern explicity
extern function can be called from a file where it is not defined i.e. no header
-extern double foo(double x) { ... }
    -the definition of the foo function effectively becomes global to any file in the program that can be called from outside the file
