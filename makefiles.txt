The makefile defines the set of source files (SRC) and 
defines the corresponding set of object files(OBJ) and
defines the name of the executable (PROG)

also defines some dependencies ($(PROG):(OBJ))
    -which says that the executable is dependent on the object files
    -if one or more of the object files change, the executable needs to be rebuilt
    -gcc $(OBJ) -o $(PROG)
the last line ($(OBJ):$(SRC))
    -says that the obj file depends on it's corresponding source file
    if a source file changes, it's correspodning object file must be rebuilt
