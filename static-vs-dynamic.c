 * static analysis is a method of debugging by automatically examining source code before a program is run
 * analysis performed on some version of the source code
 * provides understanding of code structure and helps to ensure the code adheres to industry standards
 * adddresses weakness in source code that might lead to vulnerabilities
 * often performed by an automated tool and better than code reviews
 * 
 * dynamic analysis you run the program
 * there are defects of dynamic analysis misses that static analysis can find
 * 
 * limits of static analysis
 * - no understanding of developer intent
 * - rules that are not statically enforceable (open to interpretation)
 * - possible defects lead to false positives and false negatives
